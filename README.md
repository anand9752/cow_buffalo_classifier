## üéØ Project Overview
This advanced computer vision project employs deep learning to:
1. Classify cattle images into two categories: cows üêÑ and buffaloes ü¶¨
2. Identify specific breeds within each category
3. Provide quick and accurate results through a user-friendly interface

## ‚≠ê Key Features
- Dual-stage classification (animal type + breed)
- High accuracy classification model
- Real-time processing
- User-friendly interface
- Support for multiple image formats
- Detailed prediction confidence scores

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The project follows a two-stage classification architecture:

### Stage 1: Cow/Buffalo Classification
```
Input Image ‚Üí Image Preprocessing ‚Üí CNN Model ‚Üí Animal Type Prediction
```

### Stage 2: Breed Classification
```
Classified Image ‚Üí Breed-Specific Model ‚Üí Breed Prediction
```

The system uses a hierarchical classification approach where:
1. First model determines if the image contains a cow or buffalo
2. Based on the result, appropriate breed classifier is activated
3. Final results are combined and presented to the user

## üîÑ Technical Workflow
1. **Image Input**: System accepts images in various formats (JPG, PNG)
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Image resizing to 224x224 pixels
   - Normalization
   - Data augmentation (during training)
3. **Primary Classification**:
   - Cow/Buffalo detection using CNN
   - Confidence score calculation
4. **Breed Classification**:
   - Breed-specific feature extraction
   - Breed prediction with confidence scores
5. **Result Generation**:
   - Combining both classification results
   - Presenting final output to user

## üíª Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Krishna1129/cattle_buffalo.git
cd cow-buffalo-classifier
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download pre-trained models:
- Place `best_cow_buffalo_none_classifier.pth` in the `models` directory
- Place `breed_classifier.pth` in the `models` directory

## üéÆ Usage Guide
1. Start the application:
```bash
python cattle_with_breed_classifier.py
```

2. Upload an image through the interface
3. Wait for the model to process the image
4. View results showing:
   - Animal type (Cow/Buffalo)
   - Breed identification
   - Confidence scores

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add support for more cattle breeds
- [ ] Implement real-time video classification
- [ ] Develop mobile application
- [ ] Add disease detection capabilities
- [ ] Integrate with livestock management systems
